📊 Data Analytics Internship Projects – 2025
Hey there! 🙋‍♂️
Welcome to my internship project repo! This folder contains two complete data analytics projects, each built with real-world datasets and includes:

. 🔎 A Python-based Machine Learning project

. 📈 A clean, interactive Power BI Dashboard

These projects helped me build end-to-end skills in data cleaning, feature engineering, ML modeling, visualization, and storytelling.

🛒 Project 1: E-Commerce Furniture Sales (2024)
Goal:
Predict how many units a product will sell and visually explore key sales factors like discount, price, and shipping.

🔧 Python + ML Pipeline:
. Cleaned and preprocessed raw sales data (null values, data types, price formats)

. Created new features:

. discount % = how much off the original price

. total revenue = price × units sold

. Transformed product titles with TF-IDF and tags with Label Encoding

. Built a Random Forest Regressor to predict product sales

. Tuned it using GridSearchCV to improve accuracy

. Evaluated with R² Score and Mean Squared Error

📁 File: Ecccomerce_sales_project.ipynb

📊 Power BI Dashboard:
. KPIs: Total revenue, average discount, total units sold

. Bar charts showing effect of discount & shipping type

. Scatter plot of Price vs Units Sold

. Table of individual products with revenue insights

. Filters: Discount range, price band, shipping type

🏅 Project 2: Summer Olympic Medals (1976–2008)
Goal:
Predict what type of medal (Gold, Silver, Bronze) an athlete might win based on sport, gender, year, etc.
Also, visually explore how countries and athletes performed across years.

🔧 Python + ML Pipeline:
. Cleaned and structured Olympic dataset

. Used:

. One-hot encoding for sport, gender, and city

. Label encoding for country and medal

. Split data into train/test sets

. Trained and compared multiple models:

. Logistic Regression

. XGBoost

. CatBoost

. Random Forest (Best: ~68% accuracy)

📁 File: Summer_olympic_medals_project.ipynb

📊 Power BI Dashboard:
. Total athletes, countries, and medals tracked

. Year-wise medal distribution chart

. Country-wise and gender-wise comparisons

. Top athletes and most-played sports

. Slicers: Year, medal type, country

📁 Files:

. Olympics_powerBI_dasboard.pbix

. powerBI_dashboard_img1.png

🧰 Tools Used
. Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, XGBoost, CatBoost)

. GOOGLE COLLAB 

. Power BI

. GitHub

✅ Why This Repo?
This repository shows how I:

. Handled raw datasets end-to-end

. Created models that give useful predictions

. Turned insights into clean visuals

. Combined tech skills with storytelling 📚
